## Description

QuickOut is a revolutionary mobile application designed to transform the grocery shopping experience. It allows supermarket customers to make their purchases directly from their smartphones, eliminating the need for standing in long checkout lines.

With QuickOut, you can scan the barcodes of products using your phone's camera, add them to your virtual cart, and pay for them within the app itself. The application is designed to be user-friendly, making grocery shopping a breeze.

QuickOut is not just about convenience, it's about efficiency. By digitizing the shopping process, we're able to save our users valuable time and energy. No more waiting in lines, no more hassle. Just scan, pay, and go.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and improve QuickOut, making your grocery shopping experience even better.

## Technologies

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **ASP.NET Core API**: Used for building the backend services.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: An approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.

- **Modular Monolithic Architecture**: A software architecture that combines the simplicity of a monolith with the modularity and maintainability of microservices.

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: A pattern that segregates the operations that read data (Queries) from the operations that update data (Commands) into different objects.

- **Mediator Pattern**: A behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, through a special mediator object.
